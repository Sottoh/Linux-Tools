# Linux-Tools
Script that automatically downloads useful tools for system administrators.

### included tools
- Docker
- Docker-Compose
- Wireshark
- Nmap
- Angry IP Scanner
- Curl
- Wiregaurd
- OpenVPN

These are tools I use a lot that not always comes pre-installed on your Linux distributions. 
I personally like these tools, but not everyone uses. So it's not perfect for everyone!

sudo ./Linux-Tools
```
